Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up a VPC with One Public and One Private Subnet in AWS

Step 1: Create a VPC
1. Login to AWS Console: Go to AWS Management Console and log in.
2. Navigate to VPC: Search for "VPC" and select the VPC service under "Networking & Content Delivery."
3. Create VPC:
   - Click on "Create VPC."
   - Name tag: Enter a name for your VPC (e.g., "MyVPC").
   - IPv4 CIDR block: Enter a CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
   - IPv6 CIDR block: Leave as "No IPv6 CIDR Block."
   - Tenancy: Choose Default.
   - Click "Create VPC."

Step 2: Create Subnets
- Create Public Subnet:
   - Go to "Subnets" in the VPC dashboard.
   - Click "Create subnet."
   - Name tag: "Public-Subnet."
   - VPC: Select your VPC.
   - Availability Zone: Choose an AZ (e.g., us-east-1a).
   - IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.1.0/24.
   - Click "Create subnet."
- Create Private Subnet:
   - Repeat the steps for creating a subnet.
   - Name tag: "Private-Subnet."
   - Availability Zone: Choose same or different AZ (e.g., us-east-1b).
   - IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.2.0/24.

Step 3: Create an Internet Gateway (for Public Subnet)
1. Go to "Internet Gateways" in the VPC dashboard.
2. Click "Create internet gateway" and enter a name (e.g., "MyInternetGateway").
3. Attach Internet Gateway to VPC:
   - Select the gateway and choose Actions > Attach to VPC.
   - Select your VPC and click "Attach."

Step 4: Create Route Tables
- Public Route Table:
   - Go to "Route Tables" and click "Create route table."
   - Name tag: "Public-Route-Table," select your VPC, and create it.
   - Edit Routes: Add route with Destination: 0.0.0.0/0, Target: Internet Gateway.
   - Associate Route Table with Public Subnet.
- Private Route Table:
   - Create route table for private subnet and leave default route.

Step 5: Launch EC2 Instances in the Subnets
- Public Subnet Instance:
   - Go to "EC2 Dashboard" and launch an instance with Public Subnet.
   - Auto-assign Public IP: Enabled for internet access.
- Private Subnet Instance:
   - Launch an instance with Private Subnet and disable Public IP.
   - Security Group: Allow SSH only from Public instance.

Step 6: Set Up Security Groups
1. Public Subnet Security Group: Allow inbound SSH (port 22) from your IP.
2. Private Subnet Security Group: Allow inbound SSH from the Public instanceâ€™s private IP.

Step 7: Access the Private Subnet EC2 Instance from the Public Subnet EC2 Instance
1. Connect to the Public instance using SSH.
2. From the public instance, SSH into the Private Subnet instance using its private IP.

(Optional) Set Up NAT Gateway for Outbound Internet Access from Private Subnet.

Summary:
- VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
- Subnets:
   - Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
   - Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
- Internet Gateway: Public access for Public Subnet.
- Route Tables: Public and Private Subnet Route Tables.
- Security Groups: Control access.
- Optional NAT Gateway for Private Subnet internet access.
